<h3><bold>Environment: </h3></bold>
<p>Opensource, AS3, FlashDevelop, RPG (<b>NES/SNES</b>)</p>
<br>
<h3><bold>Description: </h3><p>Currently there is no Description, however I favor games like Crystalis, Zelda I & II, Chrono Trigger and similar RPG games. This is a top down RPG with hopes of great customization, originality and a good story line. I know some people have a hard time finding demo sources for this specific type of game so I would like to participate and help those who can't learn due to lack of opensource. </bold></h2>

<h3>Notice: </h3>
<p>
Artwork is only placeholders and will abruptly be replaced by contribution or my personal team artist along the journey of development. With that being said please view with an open mind and do not base any of the progress off the current art. This game is currently in the state of what you see is what you get.
