<h3><bold>Environment: </h3></bold>
<p>Opensource, AS3, FlashDevelop, RPG (<b>NES/SNES</b>)</p>
<br>
<h3><bold>Description: </h3><p>Currently there is no Description, however I favor games like Crystalis, Zelda I & II, Chrono Trigger and similar RPG games. This is a top down RPG with hopes of great customization, originality and a good story line. I know some people have a hard time finding demo sources for this specific type of game so I would like to participate and help those who can't learn due to lack of opensource. </bold></h2>
